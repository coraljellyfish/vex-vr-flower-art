# Flower Garden Art in VEX VR

What this code does: In a simulation (background: Art Canvas+ on VEX VR), the robot draws flowers using functions, loops and variables. Each flower is made by calling a function for a "base" flower, then turning right a set number of degrees, then again calling the function for the base flower. This was to make it look the flower appear more intricate and beautiful.

There are two variables, **shift** and **size**. **shift** is the set number of degrees turned before calling the function for the 2nd base flower (see above). **size** determines how big the flower is; all of the lengths for the petals are multiplied by **size** to make the flower either larger or smaller.

This was my first time using art in code for a simulation.
